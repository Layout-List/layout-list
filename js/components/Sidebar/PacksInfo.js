        <div class="right-text">
            <p>Packs are sets of levels on the Layout List chosen by the staff team that share distinct commonalities and are within a close difficulty range (generally Â± 1 difficulty tier).</p>
            <p>If you have a suggestion for a new pack, feel free to share it with the list team in #list-discussion in our Discord server!</p>
            <p>If you beat all the levels in a pack, it gets displayed on your profile in the leaderboard!  Furthermore, send a screenshot of your list profile in #list-support in our Discord server, and we will give you the roles for the packs you've completed!</p>
