# Welcome to the Layout List website repo!

This website is a fork of the TSL template by Prometheus, but with many added features, like packs and a search bar.
The extra features were developed by sphericle and Mystikl. Please let us know if you have a feature idea or bug report!
You are free to fork this template to host your own list, we just ask that you remove the Layout List name and logo.  

# FAQ

When will ___ be added to the list?

* With the way our current system works, the staff and reliables play levels submitted to the list. If a level gets enough positive opinions from us, it is accepted!

Can I submit multiple levels in one video?

* Yes. This is actually encouraged if you are submitting more than one record at the same time.
