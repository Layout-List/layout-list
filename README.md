### Website FAQ

Can I use the Layout List template?

* I mean, sure.  Just make sure you give credit somewhere and make sure you state
  that you're not affiliated with the shitty list.

The website isnt loading!  What can I do?

* Since no webhost is perfect, downtime is expected.  You can either wait until the
  website is back online or do some behind the scene stuff and run it
  locally.

How can I request a feature?

* [Join our discord](https://discord.gg/K48VRsHsPE) and create a thread in #server-and-list-suggestions, or create an issue on this repo.

### List FAQ

How long will my record take to get accepted?

* On a normal day, it will take 0-48 hours for the record to be accepted,
  (and sometimes up to 72 hours).  If it ever is taking more than 72 hours,
  it will be announced that there is a backup of records or some site issues.

What option should I choose (completion record, progress record, or resubmitting incorrect record) when submitting a record through the LL record submitting form?

* Use completion record when you're submitting a 100% record on a level, and
  have not submitted a progress record on the level before.  Use progress
  record when you're submitting a record on a level where you achieved higher
  than the percent to qualify but under 100%, and have not submitted a progress
  record on the level before.  Use resubmitting incorrect record when you
  want to submit a completion record or a higher progress record on a level that
  you have already submitted a progress record for before, or if there is an
  issue with one of your records that needs to be fixed (such as if the fps is
  incorrect).

What's an easy way to prove I don't hack?

* Show 2-5 seconds of footage from the end of the previous attempt and the death of that
  attempt.  This is the easiest way for us to verify you arent hacking/nocliping.
  Additionally, if possible, include clicks/taps, a tap indicator (for mobile), a cps
  counter, and/or a hand cam.

It's been more than a week and my record still hasn't been added.  What should I do?

* You can ask us in
  [#list-support](https://discord.com/channels/713151800932433972/744151240765603951).
  It was probably an accidentally deleted record (yes, it happens), your name was
  misspelled, or your record was rejected for being cheated.

When will ___ be added to the list?

* With the way our current system works, the staff and relaibles play levels submitted
  to the list.  If a level gets enough positive opinions from us, it is accepted!

Can I submit multiple levels in one video?

* Yes.  This is actually encouraged if you are submitting more than one record at the
  same time.
