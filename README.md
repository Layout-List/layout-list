# Welcome to the Layout List website repo!

Obviously this list is a fork of the TSL template by Prometheus, but with many added features, like packs and a search bar.
The extra features were developed by sphericle and Mystikl. Please let us know if you have a feature idea or bug report!
You are free to fork this template to host your own list, we just ask that you remove the Layout List name and logo.  

# FAQ

It's been more than a week and my record still hasn't been added.  What should I do?

* You can ask us in
  [#list-support](https://discord.com/channels/713151800932433972/744151240765603951).
  It was probably an accidentally deleted record (yes, it happens), your name was
  misspelled, or your record was rejected for being cheated.

When will ___ be added to the list?

* With the way our current system works, the staff and relaibles play levels submitted
  to the list.  If a level gets enough positive opinions from us, it is accepted!

Can I submit multiple levels in one video?

* Yes.  This is actually encouraged if you are submitting more than one record at the
  same time.
